                            I was born in Pretoria, South Africa and lived there until I was eight years old. My family then relocated to Auckland, New Zealand, where I finished primary school and attended high school. My family moved once again to Cairns, Australia, where I attended my final year of schooling. I have dabbled in several different tertiary pursuits, but due to a broad range of interests, every avenue felt like it was closing the door on others. I am very interested in a very broad range of topics related to science, technology, and philosophy. I would love to combine a degree in science with IT.

                            <h3>Robots</h3>
                            <p>The field of robotics is advancing at an exponential rate. The innovations we see all point towards the aspiration of developing a humanoid robot. There is good reason for this beyond just simple vanity, humans are particularly good at a wide range of skills and as such are referred to as the ‘generalist specialist’ (Tarlach, 2018). Consequently, there are two phrases that are used interchangeably: ‘humanoid robot’ and ‘general-purpose’ robot. There are a number of especially important goals towards this aspiration in which inroads have been made. These include robotic vision, dexterity, and bipedal locomotion, and AI. We will look at two exciting examples of cutting-edge developments in robotics that will show we are on the precipice of developing general-purpose robots.</p>
                            <p>Robots are beginning to master hyper-realistic humanlike fine motor control. In January 2022 the British robotics company, Engineered Arts, released the first generation of their Ameca robot (Engineered Arts, 2022). Ameca is a humanoid robot that can accurately mimic human gestures and facial expressions. Examples of its gestures include yawning, waving, pointing, and shrugging, while examples of the facial expressions include, angry, thoughtful, surprised, and smiling. Ameca can achieve this level of fine motor control by the use of 17 individual motors in its head (Reilly, 2022). Ameca uses pre-programmed motion sequences that are driven by Tritium, a robotics OS developed in-house. Tritium is designed to allow programmers and non-programmers to generate custom motion sequences and behaviours with Python IDE or Virtual Robot, a software application that offers timeline asset drag and drop, key-frames, and instant playback (Engineered Arts, 2022). Tritium makes all this possible by using a 3d model of the robot that accurately replicates its capabilities (Engineered Arts, 2022). However, despite all of these amazing capabilities it is clear that Ameca is not “intelligent”. Ameca’s voice responses and verbal interaction are controlled by a remote operator and, as forementioned, Ameca’s physical actions and responses are pre-programmed. In the near future we will likely see the integration of AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-3 to give Ameca the ability to take full advantage of its capabilities and use them in a more dynamic, contextual, and ultimately human way.</p>
                            <p>The use of AI, and more specifically AI language models, and the rapid advancement therein, is already being used to propel robot intelligence. The most interesting and cutting-edge example of this comes from a collaboration of Google Research Labs with Everyday Robots, a robot-centric division of Google’s parent company, Alphabet. These two companies have worked closely to integrate a new large-scale AI language model called PaLM (Pathways Language Model) into highly dextrous semi-humanoid robots (Shankland, 2022).  PaLM was trained using a 6,144 processor machine with a large multilingual collection of books, web documents, Wikipedia articles, conversations, and programming code found on GitHub (Shankland, 2022). PaLM is combined with a robot’s control method, known as SayCan, providing a broader understanding of the world and requests by establishing the overall goal of a particular request and then reducing it to a sequence of robotic actions/steps to achieve said goal (McCracken, 2022).  The robot has a discrete set of skills, stored as textual descriptions, that PaLM will use to determine the probability both for fulfilling each step and for success when employing a particular skill within the current setting. SayCan combines these probabilities to determine the next step to take (Alford, 2022). This helps to establish a real-world grounding for feasibility in a specific setting (Kumar, 2022). </p>
                            <p>Google states that PaLM is the first time robots have used a large-scale language model and that that the integration of PaLM saw an improvement of 14% in job planning and 13% in successfully completing those jobs (Kumar, 2022). Google have also seen an improvement of 26% in the ability to plan tasks with eight or more steps. An example of one of the complex requests made was, “I left out a soda, an apple, and water. Can you throw them away and then bring me a sponge to wipe the table?” (McCracken, 2022). It is clear that in the not-too-distant future AI language models like PaLM will reduce or completely nullify the gap between human and robot intelligence and any associated skills.</p>
                            <p>General-purpose robots, which would be functionally as capable as humans, at least physically, could yield significant negative and positive impacts. The main negative impact of these robots will be economic displacement for almost all labour-based workers. We can infer this impact by considering the current effects produced by industrial robots, which are autonomous, reprogrammable, multipurpose machines that can perform a variety of tasks which include welding, painting, and packaging. Researchers, MIT professor Daron Acemoglu and Boston University professor Pascual Restrepo, found that for every industrial robot added per 1000 workers, wages decline by 0.42% and the employment-to-population ratio drops by 0.2%, which is about 3.3 workers (Brown, 2020). This effect is far greater for areas in which the robots were deployed with a loss of six workers per robot (Brown, 2020). The business strategy group, PwC, predicts that by around the mid 2030’s, 30% of jobs could be automated by robots (Hawksworth, et al., 2018). Alternatively, the positive impacts of general-purpose robots will involve improving a number of aspects of quality of life. Firstly, the ability to understand a user’s speech and respond appropriately with words, actions, and emotive facial expressions will mean that these robots could be used for communication purposes, as assistants, and even companions. Furthermore, the high mobility and dexterity will allow these robots to help with tasks that a human might be unable to perform. This could include trivial things like opening a pickle jar to disposing of nuclear waste. This could improve, the quality of life for the elderly, disabled, and those with temporary physical  limitations, and job safety. Finally, general-purpose robots will improve businesses’ efficiency, causing both a significant reduction in costs along with vastly improved output. </p>
                            <p>General-purpose robots will likely have a variety of impacts on me and my family.  I am currently working part time in a supermarket while studying IT. Prior to now, supermarkets, which require high labour investment, have only been able to replace checkout operators through automation. However, what has prevented robots replacing human labour in most supermarkets has been a lack of intelligence and dexterity in the former. Therefore, it is likely that most of the jobs currently performed in a supermarket will start to be replaced with general-purpose robots in the near future. The ability to access low-knowledge jobs as an easy means to finance while studying, could certainly be a problem for me. Alternatively, IT is a knowledge-based field that requires higher level reasoning, and other than the use of HID for work, is far less dependent on physical capabilities. However, because of the high probability of greater social disruption from higher unemployment in general, there will be flow on  of economic effects in professions that are otherwise not directly affected. My partner is a Psychologist, which again is a knowledge-base field that requires higher level reasoning. Therefore, the impacts for her would be similar to those for my intended career in IT. My parents are elderly and well established so the economic impacts might have an effect on them, including a potential increase in petty crime and volatility in cash rates. On the other hand, both have seen a decline in their physical capabilities over time. Thus, the potential to have a robotic assistant with high mobility and dexterity combined with AI language capabilities could compensate for many of their challenges. However, the ability to access general-purpose robots for regular consumers is highly unlikely to be fully realized in the near future.</p>
