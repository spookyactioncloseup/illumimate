                                <p>
                                    I was born in South Africa and moved to New Zealand at age nine before coming to Australia where I completed my last year of high school. I really enjoy philosophy, politics, science, technology, and general thoughtful conversation. My trajectory in technology started with a decommissioned IBM PS2 286 my father brought home from work. This machine had nothing more than DOS, but it challenged me to see what it could do – and really what I could do. Soon after, I started to explore gaming with multiple game consoles including, an Atari 2600, a Sega Master System II, and finally a Sony Playstation. By this stage I was already obsessed with technology, but then we got a PC with a dial up 56kb/s modem with Windows 95 and Netscape Navigator. As a young adult I started doing small web development jobs and building and repairing PC’s. This led to my interest in becoming a web developer, teaching myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. However, I found that this was more about design, repetition, and time than the challenge and impact I was looking for. I am now studying IT to broaden my understanding of the field in the hopes that I will find the perfect niche in an area that is exciting and challenging.

                                    I was born in Fiji but with an Indian background so am I Fijian Indian, one of my favorite hobbies is to listen to old radio shows, as I am big fan of Audible, audio books the spoken word and audio plays. I discovered that I love radio plays and productions, so captivating as it transports you into the play, becomes "Theatre of the Mind". My true love for technology comes from gaming and modding games. I have been playing PC games as kid and still do. I prefer PC games rather than console-based games. I love modding games and tinkering with the base files to change the aspects of game play. This includes updating stats, moving elements around, and changing the unit’s hierarchy. My favorite PC game types are long form games rather than the fast-paced action based, these are the Football Manger series, Medieval Total War series, X3 and Red Dead Redemption 2.

                                <p>
                                    I am a 28 year old woman from the Central Coast of NSW. My mother is Danish and I have spent some time in Sweden, so I can speak a basic Scandinavian language. I love to travel and learn about different cultures and people. I have been many places but my favorite is Japan and Norway. Japan for the culture and Norway for the nature. I have a German  Shepard named Muumi who I love to death. 
I’ve studied many different things including law, teaching, visual arts and I even managed to complete a diploma of Graphic Design. I like to study but seem to have a problem with losing interest after a while. However there is something about coding that I find addictive. And I have never studied from the comfort of my own home – so I am keen to continue this course.
In 2017 I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and have been working closely on healing and looking after myself. Ironically, I work in disability helping those who are most vulnerable. I did well in high school and the HSC, meaning I found it easy to study and pay attention. Since being diagnosed, I have had a hard time staying focused and leaving the house. However, I have found a job I can work from home with, and I have found this course. Both can be done from home and I find myself loving my situation. It would be easy to be doom and gloom about it, but with the right treatment and ways to keep busy, I can lead a normal happy life.

                            <p>The group was very cohesive and worked well together in Assignment 2, but did not manage to finish everything by the deadline.
                                Therefore, to improve, the group will need to make a few required changes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Definitively understand tasks required for completion and their required time and skills allocation.</li>
                                <li>Assign tasks to individuals who might have a more approximate skill set.</li>
                                <li>Set definitive deadlines for each tasks completion. Add priority to more important tasks.</li>
                                <li>Make sure to keep track of each tasks progression using a task planner/Todo application.</li>
                                <li>Create sub-grouping of team members for colloboration on certain tasks.</li>

                        <h3>UI/UX Graphic Designer</h3> 
                        <p>On our team we have Tessa, who had previous graphic design experience. Although we used her abilities, it would be advantageous to use someone with specific experience with UI/UX Design to optimise our application.    
                            We would like to employ someone who can make their mark of design direction, development, and several iterations of the application so we can see what the best outcome could be. They would be involved in day-to-day design of the app, and any websites connected to Illumimate. A vision of safety, protection and good creative problem solving skills must be found within the candidate. A potential employee would have tertiary education in either Visual Communication, IT or UX/UI Design. Strong research skills and the ability to be flexible is a must.    
                            Skills they must have include the ability to use the Adobe Suite, Figma and Mural. This means being able to produce prototypes/wireframes and display or share them to with our team.</p>
                     </p>
                     <h3>Project Leader/Co-Ordinator</h3>
                     <p>Our team had Clive and Shashi as the guides who influenced the direction of the work required. This primary done as having on the project from the start and understanding the basis of the application and the intended outcome. However, we have a group type of consensus on the additional tasks to be done, writing developing our own scripts and presentation material. A Project Leader/Co-Ordinator would guide the project by developing the roadmap from start to finish, understanding the progress being made and recording any blockers to the work. This role would also see any critical points that would stop the project from progressing or material changes to the application itself. This role would require the Leader/Co-Ordinator to be a good story writer, as they will be able to understand the project from a whole and communicate this effectively, either via a written or a verbal presentation.  </p>
                    <p>Lead Developer </p>
                    <p>We have Clive handling all the aspects of developing, coding, building a server, sourcing the right type of map, inputting, and testing. This developer would need to experience in developing map applications and incorporating elements beyond the map i.e., streetlights locations from a data input. We would look at a developer that will handle ingestion of data from API source rather than excel files as the application data will be dynamic. They will need to have a good background in mobile development. One specific area we will look for is the ability for the route that we create is based on a rating system, so the shortest route will not be the best, we will need to incorporate the rating system in to the route calculations. </p>
                    <h3>Data Analyst</h3>
                    <p>We have Shashi, handling our data sourcing, research, validation, and preparation. This role will require two key elements, 1. the source of the streetlights data and 2. research industry material, in this case lamp type and the physics behind this.  
                        The data analyst must have the ability to understand the data sources from the different local government areas are not uniform and not in the same context. Some data will have different columns and be presented differently (i.e., latitude and longitude in the same column). They must have the ability to work with the developer in a creating a data store which ingests all different structures of data and present a uniform table for use in the application. The ability to research lamp types, lumen strength and understand the context of creating a rating system to assist the develop in route calculations.  </p>
