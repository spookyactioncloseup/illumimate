                                <p>
                                    I was born in South Africa and moved to New Zealand at age nine before coming to Australia where I completed my last year of high school. I really enjoy philosophy, politics, science, technology, and general thoughtful conversation. My trajectory in technology started with a decommissioned IBM PS2 286 my father brought home from work. This machine had nothing more than DOS, but it challenged me to see what it could do – and really what I could do. Soon after, I started to explore gaming with multiple game consoles including, an Atari 2600, a Sega Master System II, and finally a Sony Playstation. By this stage I was already obsessed with technology, but then we got a PC with a dial up 56kb/s modem with Windows 95 and Netscape Navigator. As a young adult I started doing small web development jobs and building and repairing PC’s. This led to my interest in becoming a web developer, teaching myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. However, I found that this was more about design, repetition, and time than the challenge and impact I was looking for. I am now studying IT to broaden my understanding of the field in the hopes that I will find the perfect niche in an area that is exciting and challenging.

                                    I was born in Fiji but with an Indian background so am I Fijian Indian, one of my favorite hobbies is to listen to old radio shows, as I am big fan of Audible, audio books the spoken word and audio plays. I discovered that I love radio plays and productions, so captivating as it transports you into the play, becomes "Theatre of the Mind". My true love for technology comes from gaming and modding games. I have been playing PC games as kid and still do. I prefer PC games rather than console-based games. I love modding games and tinkering with the base files to change the aspects of game play. This includes updating stats, moving elements around, and changing the unit’s hierarchy. My favorite PC game types are long form games rather than the fast-paced action based, these are the Football Manger series, Medieval Total War series, X3 and Red Dead Redemption 2.

                            <h3>Clouds, Services, Servers:</h3>
                            <p>Cloud technology is a combined set of servers which are networked together to either store data, run/execute applications, or use the web browser as the interface to run applications. In many ways we have being using cloud computing without having realised this, applications like Gmail, Outlook (online), Facebook, OneDrive, DropBox, Netflix, Amazon Prime and other streaming services. The network that runs the cloud is the internet.</p>
                            <p>Cloud technology can be broken down into 3 categories. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). </p>
                            <p>IaaS is where the entire infrastructure is hosted on the cloud, this where the hardware, compute, memory storage is held on servers and networks outside of business premises. The organisation/ business doesn’t bear the cost or responsibility of housing the physical infrastructure. It connects to servers (on the cloud) and runs its workload (Oracle 2022).</p>
                            <p>PaaS – can be confused and often mixed up with SaaS (software as a service) however the differences are based on the applications and type of complicated work/tasks required to perform. With PaaS this is mostly related to software development, testing and deployment. Commonly platforms are Google cloud, Microsoft Azure, AWS (Amazon Web Services), IBM Cloud. These offer the ability to develop in the most common programming languages Ruby, Python, Java, Scala, Clojure, Node.js, PHP, .NET, Ruby, Go and Docker. (Oracle 2022).</p>
                            <p>SaaS – is an application run via the cloud without the need for installing the software on your location machine. These includes Customer Relationship Management, Enterprise Resource Planning, Accounting, Project Management, Human Resources and Payment gateways as examples of SaaS. (Oracle 2022).</p>

                            <p>Cloud computing is also broken down to three types, public, private and hybrid.</p>
                            <p>Public – this where the computing infrastructure is hosted at the location of the cloud provided and services are delivered via the internet. Customers pay for all the physical and computing power and don’t bear the cost of running their own infrastructure. (Oracle 2022).</p>

                            <p>Private- this used exclusively by enterprise organisations and businesses. This is dedicated to the organisation. The resources requested and paid by organisation or business is only dedicated to them, this includes the compute, data storage and run time and not shared by other organisations. This designed to fit the organisational which require high security, high levels of internal compliance with local and national laws. These are usually for organisations that have the capacity to fund high budget technologies  (Oracle 2022).</p>


                            <p>Hybrid – This is a combination of public cloud and private, where organizations and business house data, applications and compute on the private cloud and allow the public cloud to host second tier applications or data (Oracle 2022).</p>

                            <p>The future of cloud computing will only likely grow from a market size of 429.5 USD in 2021 to 1025.7 USD in 2028 covering the major regions of North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa (Fact & Factors 2022). The global market is mostly driven by new technologies big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. SaaS generated the biggest revenue, compared to IaaS and PaaS (Fact & Factors 2022). </p>
                            <p>The prime motivation to move cloud is the ever-increasing amount of data being generated, business and organisations desire to be customer centric with a focus on customer satisfaction (Fact & Factors 2022). Key issues are also driving business being protecting sensitive data, disaster recovery and compiling with local and national laws and regulation (Fact & Factors 2022).</p>
                            <p>The key regions for growth will be South East Asia, with China and India. India has very strong investments in industrial and IT industries which has created a strong cloud computing sector (Fact & Factors 2022).</p>

                            <p>The impact would for organisations to require more IT professionals to manage the cloud services. It will also require the upskilling of current staff to operate the applications and services by cloud providers. Routine tasks may become automated, and administration may become obsolete. This would require staff to be retrained or deployed elsewhere (Zdnet 2021). </p>

                            <p>The requirement will also be for advanced skilled IT professionals who are trained in cloud technologies will increase with the ability to migrated from a physical on-premises to a cloud-based location (Zdnet 2021). The issue that organisations face is that do not have the right suitable pool of qualified talent to fulfill this requirement of running cloud services, this is already on top of companies struggling to find IT professionals who other tasks. </p>

                            <p>As per Govekar "I was talking to another organization recently who said, 'The moment I upskill and train my person in AWS and Google or Azure, or anything else, they are [offered] more somewhere else -- I am literally training them up for someone to grab” (Zdnet 2021).</p>





                            <p>The impact for me personally would be along the lines of slowly moving from a desktop PC which houses a lot of hardware, graphics card, a very CPU (intel i-7-8700k) RAM, and data storage to a much smaller device. This could be a NUC (next unit of computing) and is considered a bare bones PC, it houses the usual hardware, but not a high-end scale set-up. I could then potentially run all my applications from a cloud service. This cloud service could compute and run applications, games, and professional programs. I would need to have strong security, a good payment gateway to use the benefits without having to upgrade or manage my files when moving to a new PC or laptop at home. </p>
                            <p>For professionals programs like data visualisations tools this would be very beneficial as the heavy computing can be done on the cloud without the danger of crashing the system if running a large file. </p>
                            <p>This could change the way gaming is now delivered as enthusiasts have always loved purchasing and build PC’s. This may now allow a new type of gamer to be involved without the need for a high-end PC build. Medium or high-end gaming could be delivered on the cloud.</p>
                            <p>My Mum would be able to run programs via a subscription model without having the need for downloading software. She is a very traditional user who has always been used either a CD copy or now downloading a program and installing this. All files and documents can easily be stored on the cloud. However, there is the danger of bad use of the internet or security password usage allowing hackers and ransomware to installed on her system. Mostly a change in her thinking around password and website usage would be required and how to operate home based 2FA services. </p>

                            <h3>Robots:</h3>
                            <p>The field of robotics is advancing at an exponential rate. The innovations we see all point towards the aspiration of developing a humanoid robot. There is good reason for this beyond just simple vanity, humans are particularly good at a wide range of skills and as such are referred to as the ‘generalist specialist’ (Tarlach, 2018). Consequently, there are two phrases that are used interchangeably: ‘humanoid robot’ and ‘general-purpose’ robot. There are a number of especially important goals towards this aspiration in which inroads have been made. These include robotic vision, dexterity, and bipedal locomotion, and AI. We will look at two exciting examples of cutting-edge developments in robotics that will show we are on the precipice of developing general-purpose robots.</p>
                            <p>Robots are beginning to master hyper-realistic humanlike fine motor control. In January 2022 the British robotics company, Engineered Arts, released the first generation of their Ameca robot (Engineered Arts, 2022). Ameca is a humanoid robot that can accurately mimic human gestures and facial expressions. Examples of its gestures include yawning, waving, pointing, and shrugging, while examples of the facial expressions include, angry, thoughtful, surprised, and smiling. Ameca can achieve this level of fine motor control by the use of 17 individual motors in its head (Reilly, 2022). Ameca uses pre-programmed motion sequences that are driven by Tritium, a robotics OS developed in-house. Tritium is designed to allow programmers and non-programmers to generate custom motion sequences and behaviours with Python IDE or Virtual Robot, a software application that offers timeline asset drag and drop, key-frames, and instant playback (Engineered Arts, 2022). Tritium makes all this possible by using a 3d model of the robot that accurately replicates its capabilities (Engineered Arts, 2022). However, despite all of these amazing capabilities it is clear that Ameca is not “intelligent”. Ameca’s voice responses and verbal interaction are controlled by a remote operator and, as forementioned, Ameca’s physical actions and responses are pre-programmed. In the near future we will likely see the integration of AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-3 to give Ameca the ability to take full advantage of its capabilities and use them in a more dynamic, contextual, and ultimately human way.</p>
                            <p>The use of AI, and more specifically AI language models, and the rapid advancement therein, is already being used to propel robot intelligence. The most interesting and cutting-edge example of this comes from a collaboration of Google Research Labs with Everyday Robots, a robot-centric division of Google’s parent company, Alphabet. These two companies have worked closely to integrate a new large-scale AI language model called PaLM (Pathways Language Model) into highly dextrous semi-humanoid robots (Shankland, 2022).  PaLM was trained using a 6,144 processor machine with a large multilingual collection of books, web documents, Wikipedia articles, conversations, and programming code found on GitHub (Shankland, 2022). PaLM is combined with a robot’s control method, known as SayCan, providing a broader understanding of the world and requests by establishing the overall goal of a particular request and then reducing it to a sequence of robotic actions/steps to achieve said goal (McCracken, 2022).  The robot has a discrete set of skills, stored as textual descriptions, that PaLM will use to determine the probability both for fulfilling each step and for success when employing a particular skill within the current setting. SayCan combines these probabilities to determine the next step to take (Alford, 2022). This helps to establish a real-world grounding for feasibility in a specific setting (Kumar, 2022). </p>
                            <p>Google states that PaLM is the first time robots have used a large-scale language model and that that the integration of PaLM saw an improvement of 14% in job planning and 13% in successfully completing those jobs (Kumar, 2022). Google have also seen an improvement of 26% in the ability to plan tasks with eight or more steps. An example of one of the complex requests made was, “I left out a soda, an apple, and water. Can you throw them away and then bring me a sponge to wipe the table?” (McCracken, 2022). It is clear that in the not-too-distant future AI language models like PaLM will reduce or completely nullify the gap between human and robot intelligence and any associated skills.</p>
                            <p>General-purpose robots, which would be functionally as capable as humans, at least physically, could yield significant negative and positive impacts. The main negative impact of these robots will be economic displacement for almost all labour-based workers. We can infer this impact by considering the current effects produced by industrial robots, which are autonomous, reprogrammable, multipurpose machines that can perform a variety of tasks which include welding, painting, and packaging. Researchers, MIT professor Daron Acemoglu and Boston University professor Pascual Restrepo, found that for every industrial robot added per 1000 workers, wages decline by 0.42% and the employment-to-population ratio drops by 0.2%, which is about 3.3 workers (Brown, 2020). This effect is far greater for areas in which the robots were deployed with a loss of six workers per robot (Brown, 2020). The business strategy group, PwC, predicts that by around the mid 2030’s, 30% of jobs could be automated by robots (Hawksworth, et al., 2018). Alternatively, the positive impacts of general-purpose robots will involve improving a number of aspects of quality of life. Firstly, the ability to understand a user’s speech and respond appropriately with words, actions, and emotive facial expressions will mean that these robots could be used for communication purposes, as assistants, and even companions. Furthermore, the high mobility and dexterity will allow these robots to help with tasks that a human might be unable to perform. This could include trivial things like opening a pickle jar to disposing of nuclear waste. This could improve, the quality of life for the elderly, disabled, and those with temporary physical  limitations, and job safety. Finally, general-purpose robots will improve businesses’ efficiency, causing both a significant reduction in costs along with vastly improved output. </p>
                            <p>General-purpose robots will likely have a variety of impacts on me and my family.  I am currently working part time in a supermarket while studying IT. Prior to now, supermarkets, which require high labour investment, have only been able to replace checkout operators through automation. However, what has prevented robots replacing human labour in most supermarkets has been a lack of intelligence and dexterity in the former. Therefore, it is likely that most of the jobs currently performed in a supermarket will start to be replaced with general-purpose robots in the near future. The ability to access low-knowledge jobs as an easy means to finance while studying, could certainly be a problem for me. Alternatively, IT is a knowledge-based field that requires higher level reasoning, and other than the use of HID for work, is far less dependent on physical capabilities. However, because of the high probability of greater social disruption from higher unemployment in general, there will be flow on  of economic effects in professions that are otherwise not directly affected. My partner is a Psychologist, which again is a knowledge-base field that requires higher level reasoning. Therefore, the impacts for her would be similar to those for my intended career in IT. My parents are elderly and well established so the economic impacts might have an effect on them, including a potential increase in petty crime and volatility in cash rates. On the other hand, both have seen a decline in their physical capabilities over time. Thus, the potential to have a robotic assistant with high mobility and dexterity combined with AI language capabilities could compensate for many of their challenges. However, the ability to access general-purpose robots for regular consumers is highly unlikely to be fully realized in the near future.</p>

                            <h3>Overview:</h3>
                            <p>
                                Illumimate is a mobile application for pedestrians that uses one’s location to find the most well-lit, safest, obstruction free, route to a desired destination.  The application is targeted towards urban and suburban pedestrians; those who don’t feel safe walking at night. The system will use a popular mapping API like Google Maps and combine it with data inputs from the application administrators and trusted end users. The data will come from a number of different sources, including popular paths, number of lights and general illumination in an area, construction work notices, up to date hot maps from tracking users, and direct user inputs. 
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Motivation:</h3>
                            <p>
                                The motivation for Illumimate comes from wanting to use readily available technologies to help individuals feel safe and mitigate the potential for an array of crimes that are committed on a number of people every day. If we look at just one alarming crime statistic from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the number of sexual assaults in 2021 occurring in a non-residential setting, was 10,155. The overall number of sexual assaults increased by 13% from 2020 to 2021 (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2022). “Research has consistently shown violence and harm in late-night entertainment areas peaks between midnight and 3 am, and occurs most frequently on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights” Chikritzhs & Stockwell 2002, Chikritzhs et al. 2007; Ireland & Thommeny 1993. In Stephen Tomsen, 2016. There is more than enough technological know-how  and readily available data to try and eliminate some of these statistics and established trends.

                            <h3>Description:</h3>
                            <p>
                                Illumimate is a cross platform mobile application designed to help pedestrians with access to a smart phone find routes for any destination with the most illumination and least impediments. Illumimate will have the following features and concepts:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Primary information submitted by administrators:</h4>
                                        Illumimate will get its primary information and updates from the application administrators. Users will be able to provide their own updates to this information, albeit with a higher level of scrutiny.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Rate and review route for other users:</h4>
                                        After a user has reached their destination the app will use the well-established mobile application popup with rate and review. This will ask a user for a review of the route with a breakdown of most important metrics and a rating out of 5 stars. These categories could include: ‘Route as Illuminated as Suggested’, ‘Route as Fast as Suggested’, ‘Was the Route as Described’. Underneath this there could be a textual review giving better insight into any issues that might exist.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Filtering results:</h4>
                                        Lighting and certain impediments alone are not always a good way to measure safety, with expeditiousness also being extremely important. For this reason, Illumimate will include a set of parameters and their importance to the user. This will be presented as a range of horizontal slide toggles from not important to very important. This will be established when setting up one’s profile. Users will be able to change their defaults at any time in their profile settings. When a user enters their destination, it will rank each route against these and sort them from best match to worst, in a descending order. The user will be able to use dynamic override filters from the route suggestion search screen. Finally, the user will be given quick/popular options like ‘Most Illuminated Route’, ‘Fastest Route’, ‘Most Liked Route’, etc.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Push location to chosen contacts:</h4>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                Once a user has selected their route, Illumimate will offer the users the ability to share their live location, with short interval polling, to any number of their phone or social media contacts. The tracking will show a user’s personalized avatar on a map,  also give the time started and an estimated time of arrival at destination.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Users will be able to configure an SOS with emergency contacts. If the user goes off track or stops for too long, they will be given a notification to update the situation. This could be simply ‘Done’ and ‘Pause’. This will need a simple security check to prevent impersonation. If the user does not respond after a certain period of time, set in the user’s profile settings, the application will send out an SOS to emergency contacts.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                The user can notify local law enforcement (Police) of their location and current situation. This can also private security which patrol business as a security service and have an obligation to assist.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Any local law enforcement offices within a close proximity to the route will be highlighted to the user.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                The user can see which venues are open being usually restaurants, clubs, convenience stores or other safe harbour venues which may assist. Restaurants and clubs have private security (bouncers) which have an obligation to look after patrons. It is acceptable for a person to walk into a venue looking for assistance and the venue would have an obligation to assist. 
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Live update from location:</h4>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                Users will be able to report issues with existing infrastructure. This will present your live location on the map and the street light locations. Here the user will tap on any light that has an issue. 
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                For missing lights and features users will be able to use a drag and drop library of elements to add permanent features to the map, pending approval.  This information can also be supplied to councils and responsible municipal bodies for their own records and potential confirmation of suggestion.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Add dynamic temporary items or situations:
                                                Users will also be able to add dynamic temporary items from the library such as roadworks or an unsafe situation. The user will have the option to add an expected duration for the temporary item, otherwise a default time period will be built into each item.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Users can include a textual message from their current location for all other users to see.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Users will be given the option to create an incident report if anything criminal took place on their route and the approximate location. This will likely need a ranking system for type of incident so that it can be algorithmically weighted for future route suggestions.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>User scrutiny / trust:</h4>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Users will need to provide proof of their identity using a two-factor authentication.</li>
                                            <li>Users will get tiered and promoted for their interactions and helpfulness. Using terms of high value such as ‘The Owl’, ‘The Defender’, ‘The Chosen One’, etc.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><h4>Analysis of metrics:</h4>
                                        Illumimate will keep an anonymous record of each user’s choices and routes. This will allow the platform to provide better understanding of what users want for their routes. This will also allow for dynamic determination that something is wrong with a route due to decrease in popularity for a portion thereof. This will also be used to use user tiers to rank any data they have provided.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                        <li>Map API like Google Map Platform.</li>
                                        <li>iOS and Android dev tools to access security features (including biometrics), GPS, etc.</li>
                                        <li>Access to local road and transport information. This could come from council/municipality and or regional/state government.</li>
                                        <li>Cloud server hosting like Azure or Amazon AWS.</li>
                                        <li>Cross platform application library, potentially web technologies based like React Native or Ionic.</li>
                                        <li>2FA API like Authy to confirm users’ identity for allowing route information sharing by users.</li>
                                        <li>Social media API’s to access extra ‘non-phone’ contacts.</li>
                                        <li>Web stack technologies:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Frontend: html, css, javascript. This can include any popular technologies that transpile to these languages including Sass for CSS and Typescript for JavaScript. </li>
                                                <li>Backend: Node JS. For consistency between frontend and backend development and the consequent simplicity it is beneficial to use Node JS on the backend. Node JS is also very mature and has much better IO throughput than PHP and Python with better asynchronous capability.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Non-relational, highly scalable, open-source database like Mongo DB. This will allow users to submit varying amounts of information and leave unknown details empty.</li>
                                        <li>Restful API for transacting data between developers, users, and the server.</li>

                                        <li>Understanding of data analysis and transformation, especially in the context of a medium throughput/transaction non-relational database.</li>
                                        <li>Ability to work with web stack technologies, including html, css, javascript, nodeJS, and databases.</li>
                                        <li>Ability to work with a cross platform JavaScript library such as React Native to build a cross platform app for both iOS and Android.</li>
                                        <li>Development of REST API for data requests and submissions.</li>
                                        <li>Ability to work with and integrate third party API’s such as Google Maps Platform, Authy for 2FA, and social media like Facebook for ‘non phone’ contacts.</li>
                                        <li>Good understanding of UI and UIX to make sure the Illumimate is easy to use, helpful, and intuitive. Good UI and UIX implementation are extremely important to making sure all intended features are integrated in a way that promotes their utilization – the app works the way it was supposed to.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>The skills listed above are ubiquitous in the IT industry.  Any areas that are weak within our group would be easily found, making development from a skills perspective highly feasible.</p>
                                </div>

                                    <h3>Outcome:</h3>
                                    <p>Illumimate will have the potential to improve the confidence of individuals who want or need to walk late at night but are otherwise unsure of the safety in doing so. This could help users save some money from not having to use public transport, taxis, and ride share platforms. The platform could potentially reduce crime stats. If the application gained in popularity, would-be perpetrators would likely become aware of the application’s existence and be less likely to engage in criminal activity towards potential victims.  This could really bolster the night-time economy of urban areas by providing a reduced sense of anxiety related to overall safety. Finally, as a side effect of information gathering by platform administrators and users, this could be shared with the appropriate governing bodies to improve related public utilities.  This could include the improvement of infrastructure reporting for public guidance materials, more timely maintenance of public lighting, improved amount of public lighting in high traffic areas, and notification of unknown impediments.</p>
