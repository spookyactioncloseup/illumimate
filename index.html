                                <p>
                                    I was born in South Africa and moved to New Zealand at age nine before coming to Australia where I completed my last year of high school. I really enjoy philosophy, politics, science, technology, and general thoughtful conversation. My trajectory in technology started with a decommissioned IBM PS2 286 my father brought home from work. This machine had nothing more than DOS, but it challenged me to see what it could do – and really what I could do. Soon after, I started to explore gaming with multiple game consoles including, an Atari 2600, a Sega Master System II, and finally a Sony Playstation. By this stage I was already obsessed with technology, but then we got a PC with a dial up 56kb/s modem with Windows 95 and Netscape Navigator. As a young adult I started doing small web development jobs and building and repairing PC’s. This led to my interest in becoming a web developer, teaching myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. However, I found that this was more about design, repetition, and time than the challenge and impact I was looking for. I am now studying IT to broaden my understanding of the field in the hopes that I will find the perfect niche in an area that is exciting and challenging.

                                <p>
                                    I am a proud Aboriginal Australian woman whose family hails from Gunditjmara land. After obtaining a Certificate III in Screen and Media during school, I realised that I had an interest in IT and would like to explore this interest to see if a career in this industry is for me. I am an avid dancer who has trained in the styles of jazz, tap, contemporary, lyrical and ballet since the age of 3. Recently I have started Pilates and have joined a basketball team for the first time. I am passionate about women’s safety which is what lead me to the idea behind “Illumimate" and thus the creation of the light bringers.

                                    I was born in Fiji but with an Indian background so am I Fijian Indian, one of my favorite hobbies is to listen to old radio shows, as I am big fan of Audible, audio books the spoken word and audio plays. I discovered that I love radio plays and productions, so captivating as it transports you into the play, becomes "Theatre of the Mind". My true love for technology comes from gaming and modding games. I have been playing PC games as kid and still do. I prefer PC games rather than console-based games. I love modding games and tinkering with the base files to change the aspects of game play. This includes updating stats, moving elements around, and changing the unit’s hierarchy. My favorite PC game types are long form games rather than the fast-paced action based, these are the Football Manger series, Medieval Total War series, X3 and Red Dead Redemption 2.

                            <p>The group was very cohesive and worked well together in Assignment 2, but did not manage to finish everything by the deadline.
                                Therefore, to improve, the group will need to make a few required changes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Definitively understand tasks required for completion and their required time and skills allocation.</li>
                                <li>Assign tasks to individuals who might have a more approximate skill set.</li>
                                <li>Set definitive deadlines for each tasks completion. Add priority to more important tasks.</li>
                                <li>Make sure to keep track of each tasks progression using a task planner/Todo application.</li>
                                <li>Create sub-grouping of team members for colloboration on certain tasks.</li>
